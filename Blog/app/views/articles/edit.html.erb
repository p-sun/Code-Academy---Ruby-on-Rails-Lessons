<h1>Editing article</h1>

<!-- :patch => submit via the PATCH HTTP method -- the method used for updates accrd to REST protocol
        ( protocol is viewable in 'rails routes'
      Thus PATCH to articles/:id, will call the update method in the articles_controller.rb

Note! Here, we can simplify the form_for b/c  @article is a resource corresponding to a full set of RESTful routes.
From:     form_for :article, url: article_path(@article), method: :patch do |f|
To:       form_for @article do |f|
 -->
<%= render 'form' %>

<%= link_to 'Back', articles_path %>
